Explanation:
    Since if(!(aPersonWithJob instanceof PersonWithJob)) is satisfied program returns false
    PersonWithJob is inheriting Person it will be an instance of Person class,
    and we can't cast Person to PersonWithJob

Solution:
    Instead of inheriting from Person, we can use composition
    We can create a Person object in PersonWithJob and forward requests for Person functionality
